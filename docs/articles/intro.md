# MADE.NET

MADE.NET is a toolkit of easy-to-use extensions, helpers, and controls to make app development easier for .NET developers.

Whether you're building an ASP.NET Core Web API or a native UI application with Uno Platform, MADE.NET has something for everyone.

MADE.NET has been built on common code from projects built by the MADE team, and is now a home for all those bits of code that you know you will reuse in another project!

## Why should I use this project?

Have you ever built applications and found yourself copying some code from one project to another? 

Me too! 

That's where MADE.NET started, a toolkit that brought together all of those code snippets, extensions, helpers, and controls that help me to build the applications I work on every day.

Here you'll find tried and tested components that are deployed in real-world, large-scale applications used across the continents. 

Whether you're building the next big public platform, or a niche enterprise application, you'll find all the needs bundled into the MADE libraries.

## Can I bring my reusable code to MADE.NET?

Absolutely! MADE.NET is evolving, and we actively encourage community contributions.

Whether it's a short extension method, or a new big feature, we accept any contributions that we know will make a difference to any project!

You'll know you have reusable code when you realize that it is not domain specific to your application. Think value converters, or math extensions. Developers need these, and they need to stop reinventing the wheel!
