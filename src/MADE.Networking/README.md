The MADE.NET Networking library comes fully loaded with wrappers for easily executing network requests from applications, handling the responses, as well as providing extensions for common URI scenarios. A perfect companion to any application handling networking.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **Network Requests** - A collection of out-of-the-box network request wrappers including:
  - **JsonGetNetworkRequest** for executing a GET call with a JSON response
  - **JsonPostNetworkRequest** for executing a POST call with a JSON payload and response
  - **JsonPutNetworkRequest** for executing a PUT call with a JSON payload and response
  - **JsonPatchNetworkRequest** for executing a PATCH call with a JSON payload and response
  - **JsonDeleteNetworkRequest** for executing a DELETE call with a JSON response
  - **StreamGetNetworkRequest** for executing a GET call with a `Stream` response
- **NetworkRequestManager** - A service that can handle the processing of `NetworkRequest` instances in the background of a running application with callbacks on responses. Useful for when you want a fire-and-forget style networking approach. [Discover how to use the NetworkRequestManager in your apps](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/features/networking.html#queuing-your-network-requests-using-networkrequestmanager).
- **HttpResponseMessage{T}** - Extending the base `HttpResponseMessage` type to allow deserializing content to a specific type.
- **HttpResponseMessageExtensions** - Providing helper methods for allowing `HttpResponseMessage` responses to be deserialized easily. [Find out more about HttpResponseMessage extensions](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Networking.Extensions.HttpResponseMessageExtensions.html).
- **UriExtensions** - A collection of extensions for manipulating URI values such as getting a specific value from a query. [Explore more helpers for URI values](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Networking.Extensions.UriExtensions.html).
