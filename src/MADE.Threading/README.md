The MADE.NET Threading library provides helpers and extensions that help with application scenarios that care about threads. Amongst the features, you'll find an improved take on the .NET `Timer` implementation to make it easier for you to use in your apps!

## Features ‚≠ê

- **Timer** - Providing an easy-to-use alternative to the `System.Threading.Timer` with `Start` and `Stop` methods.
- **TaskExtensions** - A collection of methods that build on the `Task` type to provide support for ensuring thrown exceptions are observed, and simply call `WhenAll` and `WhenAny` on `Task` collections. [Find out more about extensions for Tasks](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Threading.TaskExtensions.html).

## Getting started

### Get the library

You can install the Threading library into your dotnet application by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package MADE.Threading
```

Or by adding the `MADE.Threading` package in your NuGet package manager of choice.
