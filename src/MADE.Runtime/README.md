The MADE.NET Runtime library is a base library that builds on .NET to provide additional types and extensions that you might expect to find in the BCL, but might not exist, such as a `WeakReferenceCallback`.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **Chain** - A wrapper for an object type that allows you to chain together multiple instances to perform synchronous and asynchronous actions on them handled using `WeakReference`s.
- **WeakReferenceCallback** - An approach to performing callbacks at a later point in time using `WeakReference`s to the originator. Used in the MADE.NET Networking library for handling callbacks to fire-and-forget network requests using the `NetworkRequestManager`.
- **WeakReferenceEventHandler** - Similar to the callback, providing an approach to event handlers using `WeakReference`s.
- **ReflectionExtensions** - Providing helper methods that take advantage of Reflection APIs to get property names or specific property values from objects. [Find out more about reflection extensions](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Runtime.Extensions.ReflectionExtensions.html).

## Getting started

### Get the library

You can install the Runtime library into your dotnet application by running the following command:

```

Or by adding the `MADE.Runtime` package in your NuGet package manager of choice.
