The MADE.NET for ASP.NET Core library builds on features of ASP.NET Core to provide better support for your web API or MVC applications, including standardized pagination support, global authenticated user accessor, standardized exception handling with JSON responses, and API versioning.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **HttpContextExceptionsMiddleware** - For handling application-wide exceptions thrown within an HTTP context providing JSON responses for known, registered exception types.
- **AuthenticatedUserAccessor** - For capturing the authenticated user of an HTTP context and providing a wrapper around the `ClaimsPrincipal`.
- **PaginatedRequest** and **PaginatedResponse** - For standardizing the approach to creating a request to retrieve paginated data from a source, and the expected response object that automatically calculates pages based on the request.
- **ApiVersioningExtensions** - Providing helper methods for configuring your web API with versioning support either via query or header. [Find out more about extensions for API versioning](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Web.Extensions.ApiVersioningExtensions.html).
- **HttpResponseExtensions** - A collection of extensions for `HttpResponse` objects that wrapper JSON.NET to provide a standard approach to writing responses back as a JSON result based on a specified object. [Explore more helpers for HttpResponse objects](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Web.Extensions.HttpResponseExtensions.html).
