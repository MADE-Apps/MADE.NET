The MADE.NET for ASP.NET Core MVC library builds on features of ASP.NET Core MVC to provide additional MVC-specific functionality to improve your web applications.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **InternalServerErrorObjectResult** - For providing an out-of-the-box 500 response error from a controller.
- **JsonResult** - For capturing a result object as a JSON string with a custom status code and serialization settings.
- **ControllerBaseExtensions** - Providing helper methods for `ControllerBase` objects that allow you to return JSON or InternalServerError result objects easily. [Find out more about extensions for controllers](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Web.Mvc.Extensions.ControllerBaseExtensions.html).
