The MADE.NET for EF Core library builds on the base Entity Framework library to provide base classes and helpers for maintaining data in databases.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **EntityBase** - A base definition for an EF context object that includes a default primary key, as well as created and updated dates. It also has backing interfaces so you can pick and choose the bits you need to create your own. [Find out more about the EntityBase and the interfaces in our documentation](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.EFCore.html).
- **UtcDateTimeConverter** - A converter for EF contexts to ensure that date values of models in the context are stored with a UTC kind.
- **DbContextExtensions** - A collection of helper extensions to `DbContext` objects that allow you to easily update and save changes to entities, set `EntityBase` dates automatically when saving, or safely try an action on a context. [Discover the extensions for DbContext instances](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.EFCore.Extensions.DbContextExtensions.html).
- **EntityBaseExtensions** - Methods that help to configure the `EntityBase` models when creating an entity type configuration for EF, such as configuring the primary key and date values. [Explore more helpers for EntityBase](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.EFCore.Extensions.EntityBaseExtensions.html).
- **QueryableExtensions** - Helpful extensions for EF `IQueryable` functions that provide support for pagination and smarter ordering capabilities. [Explore all the queryable extensions](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.EFCore.Extensions.QueryableExtensions.html).
