The MADE.NET Diagnostics library provides helpers to make debugging and logging results in your applications easier.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **AppDiagnostics** - An global exception handler for applications, with additional native app support for handling exceptions thrown in UWP, Android, and iOS applications.
- **FileEventLogger** - A simple event logger that can store the log to disk, with additional native app support for handling file systems in UWP, Android, and iOS applications.
- **StopwatchHelper** - A wrapper for creating and managing `Stopwatch` instances for calling methods with message outputs that include the detail of the Stopwatch and the elapsed time. Perfect for handling the timing of your code execution without the boilerplate setup for a `Stopwatch`. Run as many for as long as you need them with simple `Start` and `Stop` method calls.

### Get the library

You can install the Diagnostics library into your dotnet application by running the following command:
