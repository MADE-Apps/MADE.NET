The MADE.NET Collections library allows you to easily interact with collections, lists, arrays, and dictionaries with out-of-the-box extensions. It also comes with implementations for new collection types and comparison helpers.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **GenericEqualityComparer** - For providing an equality comparer wrapper for any type.
- **ObservableItemCollection** - An ObservableCollection that manages both collection change events as well as contained item property change events.
- **CollectionExtensions** - Extending collection objects with methods for easily updating an existing object in the collection, or updating a collection to equal each other. [Discover the extensions available for collections in our documentation](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Collections.CollectionExtensions.html).
- **DictionaryExtensions** - Providing helper methods for adding or updating items in a dictionary based on a given key, or getting a value or default for a given key. [Find out more about extensions for dictionaries](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Collections.DictionaryExtensions.html).
- **QueryableExtensions** - A collection of extensions for queryable objects that allow chunking queries into batched sizes. [Explore more helpers for queryable objects](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Collections.QueryableExtensions.html).
