The MADE.NET Data Validation for FluentValidation library builds on the base FluentValidation library to provide an easy-to-use validator collection implementation that can chain together validators for a single value.

Built on top of the MADE.NET Data Validation library, you also get all the goodness of the two validation libraries in one place. Bring the best of both worlds together!

## Features ‚≠ê

- **FluentValidatorCollection** - A `List` implementation that supports chaining `IValidator` implementations together for validating a single value using FluentValidation validators.

## Getting started

You can install the Data Validation for FluentValidation library into your dotnet application by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package MADE.Data.Validation.FluentValidation
```
