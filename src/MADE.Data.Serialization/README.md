The MADE.NET Data Serialization library provides out-of-the-box serialization helpers and extensions for ensuring data quality when serializing to and from different formats such as JSON and XML.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **JsonTypeMigrationSerializationBinder** - A JSON.NET serialization binder that allows an object type serialized to a JSON string can be migrated to a different object type. Useful when JSON has been serialized with the `TypeNameHandling` set to **All**. [Find out more about how to use the binder in your own projects](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/articles/features/data-serialization.html#handling-type-changes-in-json-objects-serialized-with-jsonnet-with-typenamehandling-set-to-all).
