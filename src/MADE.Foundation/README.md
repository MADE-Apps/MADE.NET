The MADE.NET Foundation library is a base library for MADE.NET that allows platform-specific logic to be defined with a helper for ensuring your code can continue to execute with API availability checks. You can even use this in your own projects!

## Features ‚≠ê

- **PlatformApiHelper** - A helper that can check if a `Type`, method, or property of a type is supported by validating the existence of the `PlatformNotSupportedAttribute`.
- **PlatformNotSupportedAttribute** - An attribute that can be applied to a `Type`, method, or property of a type that should not be supported by a given platform.
- **PlatformNotSupportedException** - An exception that can be thrown if a `PlatformNotSupportedAttribute` is found.

## Getting started

### Get the library

You can install the Foundation library into your dotnet application by running the following command:

```bash
dotnet add package MADE.Foundation
```

Or by adding the `MADE.Foundation` package in your NuGet package manager of choice.
