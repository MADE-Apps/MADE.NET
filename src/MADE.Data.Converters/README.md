The MADE.NET Data Converters library provides out-of-the-box value converters for taking values of one type and changing them to another. The advantage of the IValueConverter is that they can be chained together. The library also contains extension helpers for converting values directly.

## Features ‚≠ê

- **BooleanToStringValueConverter** - For converting between a boolean and a specified string value representing true or false.
- **DateTimeToStringValueConverter** - A converter for changing DateTime values to and from string values representing them.
- **StringToBase64StringValueConverter** - Easily convert to and from base64 strings with a value converter.
- **BooleanExtensions** - Providing helper methods for directly formatting boolean values as specified strings. [Find out more about extensions for boolean values](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.Converters.Extensions.BooleanExtensions.html).
- **CollectionExtensions** - A collection of extensions for converting collections to delimited strings, for example, comma-separated. [Explore more helpers for collections](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.Converters.Extensions.CollectionExtensions.html).
- **DateTimeExtensions** - Helpful extensions that manipulate DateTime values including rounding to the nearest hour, or retrieving an age based on a date of birth. [Discover all the DateTime converter extensions](https://made-apps.github.io/MADE.NET/api/MADE.Data.Converters.Extensions.DateTimeExtensions.html).
- **StringExtensions** - Methods that help you to convert string values into other formats such as converting to and from base64, or safely converting a string to an int, double, float, or boolean.
